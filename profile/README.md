## Overview
Formal Land is dedicated to enhancing security and reliability through advanced formal verification techniques. We specialize in verifying blockchain implementations, smart contracts, and systems software to ensure they meet the highest standards of correctness.

## Projects
### L1 of Tezos
We achieved a milestone by formally verifying over 100,000 lines of OCaml code for [Tezos](https://tezos.com/)' layer 1, including its storage system and smart contracts VM.

### Rust Language
Developed [coq-of-rust](https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-rust), a tool for verifying large Rust programs, funded by [Aleph Zero](https://alephzero.org/).

### EVM Verification
We're verifying the equivalence of [Python EVM](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs) and [Rust EVM](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm) implementations, leveraging [coq-of-rust](https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-rust) and [coq-of-python](https://github.com/formal-land/coq-of-python).

### Upcoming Projects
Stay tuned for announcements on our next formal verification project aimed at improving dApp security.
